Climate Change in Geneva: Weather Evolution from 1962 to Today
🌍 Project Overview
This project explores the evolution of climate indicators in Geneva over the last six decades. Using historical meteorological data, it analyzes key variables such as temperature, precipitation, sunshine hours, and snowfall to investigate trends and potential signs of climate change.
🎯 Project Objectives
Visualize Geneva's weather evolution from 1962 to the present
Make climate data more accessible and understandable
Build technical skills by integrating multiple tools: Python, SQL, Power BI, and Streamlit
📊 Data Source
All data was obtained from the official statistical portal of Geneva: https://statistique.ge.ch/domaines/02/02_02/tableaux.asp#3
The dataset includes:
Yearly average, minimum, and maximum temperatures
Total yearly rainfall and snowfall
Total sunshine hours per year
🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Step Tool        Description
1    Excel       Cleaned and reformatted the raw weather data
2    SQLite      Created a local database to store structured data
3    Python      Used Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Streamlit
4    Power BI    Designed interactive dashboards and extreme highlights
5    Streamlit   Built a web app to visualize and explore the data

🔍 Key Features
Python & Streamlit App:
-Trends Tab: Dynamic filtering by year range for temperature, rain, sunshine, and snow
-Highlights Tab: Summary of extreme years (hottest, coldest, wettest, driest, etc.)
-Power BI Tab: Embedded dashboard with option to download PDF report

Power BI Dashboard:
-Line charts for temperature trends
-Bar charts for rain, sunshine, and snow
-Summary table of yearly extremes
